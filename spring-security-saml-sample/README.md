## Spring Security SAML Sample with Spring Boot ##
This sample uses the plain old spring-security-saml library to add SP capabilities to a Spring Boot app, allowing it to authenticate against different IdPs.
The main purpose of this module is to expose the extensive configuration required to use Spring Security SAML, in comparison with the `spring-boot-security-saml` plugin for Spring Boot, that deals with all this complexities internally.
